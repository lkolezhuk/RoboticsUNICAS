When you have to run simulation with VRep:
# Start simultation sequence:
# 1) run simulation on VRep
# 2) run simulation on Matlab

if there are not issues, simulations end and automatically stop 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to stop the simulation:
# Stop simulation sequence:
# 1) stop simulation on matlab
# 2) stop simulation on vrep

(if you do not use the above sequence the VRep robot model in the next simulation will start from the last assumed cofiguration and not from the starter one)
